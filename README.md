# lazyload-picturefill-img-gallery
A demo of an image gallery that uses the HTML5 `<picture>` element and [unveil.js](https://github.com/luis-almeida/unveil) to lazyload device-appropriate images. This example is set up to serve mobile, desktop, or desktop retina images depending on device, and uses [picturefill.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) for cross browser compatibility.
